Security Policy

We take the security of this project seriously and appreciate responsible disclosures.

Reporting a Vulnerability

- Do not open public GitHub issues for security reports.
- Preferred: use GitHub Security Advisories (Security → Advisories → Report a vulnerability) to submit a private report.
- Alternate: email rscodify@gmail.com if you cannot use Advisories.

Please include:

- Description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (PoC, requests, screenshots)
- Affected versions/commits and environment details
- Suggested mitigations or patches (if any)

We acknowledge within 3 business days and provide regular updates until resolution.

Coordinated Disclosure

- Allow reasonable time to investigate and release a fix before public disclosure.
- Target timeline: patch and disclosure within 90 days (faster for critical issues).
- We will credit reporters upon request after validation and remediation.

Supported Versions

- main branch (active development)
- latest released versions of server and client packages

Older versions may receive fixes at our discretion. Upgrading to the latest release is recommended.

Best Practices in This Repo

- Use environment variables for secrets; avoid committing credentials.
- Keep dependencies updated; report vulnerable transitive dependencies.
- Limit logging of sensitive information in both client and server.

Encryption

If you need to send sensitive details by email, request a temporary secure channel or ask for a PGP key via the security contact above.

Thank you for helping keep this project and its users safe.
