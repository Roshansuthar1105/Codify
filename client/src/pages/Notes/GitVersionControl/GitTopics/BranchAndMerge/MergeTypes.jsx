                    When you use `git merge`, Git employs one of two primary strategies to integrate changes: a "fast-forward" merge or a "three-way" merge. The strategy Git chooses depends entirely on the structure of the commit history between the two branches you're merging. Understanding both is key to managing your project's history effectively.

                        A **fast-forward** merge is a simple pointer update, possible only on a linear path. A **three-way** merge is a true merge that combines two diverging histories by creating a brand new commit.

                            This occurs when the branch you're merging into (e.g., `main`) has not had any new commits since your feature branch was created. Since there are no diverging changes to reconcile, Git can simply "fast-forward" the `main` branch pointer to the latest commit of your feature branch.

                            This is the more common scenario. It happens when the branch you're merging into has new commits that your feature branch doesn't have. The histories have diverged. Git must create a new **merge commit** to tie the two histories together. This commit has two parentsâ€”one from each branch.

                            Sometimes, you may want to create a merge commit even when a fast-forward is possible. This is useful for preserving the historical context of a feature branch, clearly marking in the history where a feature was completed and integrated. This is a common practice for pull requests on platforms like GitHub.
