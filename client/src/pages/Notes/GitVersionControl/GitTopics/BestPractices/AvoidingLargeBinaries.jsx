                    One of the most important rules for maintaining a healthy and efficient Git repository is to avoid committing large binary files directly. Git is a version control system for source code, not a file storage service for large assets. Committing them leads to a bloated repository that becomes slow and difficult to work with for everyone.

                        The modern solution is **Git Large File Storage (LFS)**. Instead of storing large files in your repository, you store lightweight text *pointers*. The actual file data is stored on a dedicated server, keeping your repository small and fast.

                        If a large file is already in your commit history, tracking it with LFS won't fix the problem. You must rewrite the repository's history to remove the file. This is an advanced and potentially destructive operation. Tools like `git lfs migrate` are designed for this.
